# EmberJS Community Guidelines

### Creating New Channels
The Ember community is prolific!  We want to support add-on creators, meetups and all the rest, but it's really hard to balance that support with making EmberJS Community slack approachable.

New channels can be requested by contacting one of the [team admins or owners][team_members] with the proposed name and topic description.  Generally, new channels are only created once a critical mass exists around the topic has been established.  We use things like [NPM downloads](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ember-data) and [Github Stars](https://github.com/emberjs/data), but we intend to use our best judgement.  Our end goal is to keep the signal-to-noise ratio high.

Some short term initiatives such as Glimmer, Ember 2.0, EmberConf, etc., may also warrant a unique channel while relevant.  We'll account for those and lean on the voice of the community to judge their need.

### Pruning channels
Over time, channels can become quiet.  This may be a result of an add-on living past it's usefulness or an event passing.  Any channel without regular activity over the course of 2 weeks can be nominated for removal.  This can be done simply by dropping a message in general to that affect and mentioning one of the [team admins][team_members].

If and when a channel is deemed fit for archiving, we'll work with those who may wish to continue the discussion to find a new home.  We'll include some forwarding links in the channel and possibly use @channel to announce the move.

### Notifying via @channel, @everyone or @group
We have the announcements channel if you want to share something big with the whole world.  In the case of zero-day issues, [Team Owners and Admins][team_members] can distribute notifications via `@everyone`, `@channel`, or `@group`.  Be respectful of the many timezones who will receive notifications.

### Code of Conduct
The EmberJS Community Slack has grown more than any of the creators might have hoped.  With that great community come the challenges of assuring folks feel comfortable and supported.  With those goals in mind we've adopted a [Code of Conduct](./CodeOfConduct.md).

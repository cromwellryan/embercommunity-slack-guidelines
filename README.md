# EmberJS Community Guidelines

### Creating New Channels
The Ember community is prolific!  We want to support add-on creators, meetups and all the rest, but it's really hard to balance that support with making EmberJS Community slack approachable.

New channels can be requested by contacting one of the [team admins or owners][team_members] with the proposed name and topic description.  Generally, new channels are only created once a critical mass exists around the topic has been established.  We use things like [NPM downloads](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ember-data) and [Github Stars](https://github.com/emberjs/data), but we intend to use our best judgement.  Our end goal is to keep the signal-to-noise ratio high.

Some short term initiatives such as Glimmer, Ember 2.0, EmberConf, etc., may also warrant a unique channel while relevant.  We'll account for those and lean on the voice of the community to judge their need.

### Pruning channels
Over time, channels can become quiet.  This may be a result of an add-on living past it's usefulness or an event passing.  Any channel without regular activity over the course of 2 weeks can be nominated for removal.  This can be done simply by dropping a message in general to that affect and mentioning one of the [team admins][team_members].

If and when a channel is deemed fit for archiving, we'll work with those who may wish to continue the discussion to find a new home.  We'll include some forwarding links in the channel and possibly use @channel to announce the move.

### Notifying via @channel, @everyone or @group
We have the announcements channel if you want to share something big with the whole world.  In the case of zero-day issues, [Team Owners and Admins][team_members] can distribute notifications via `@everyone`, `@channel`, or `@group`.  Be respectful of the many timezones who will receive notifications.

### Code of Conduct
Possibly model after Web Performance Slack Code of Conduct
(RC) We now have 1315 members in general.  I'm not excited about what happens when someone is a jerk.  No CoC stops that, but it provides some guideposts to work with when it does.
